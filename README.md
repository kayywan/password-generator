# password-generator
Here, I am developing a password generator that would randomize a combination of special characters, upper case letters, lower case letters, and numbers.  Users are also able to select the length of the password, with the condition of minimum 8 characters and a maximum of 128.  

JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap were used in conjunction.  This was quite the challenge, as I still had troubles working with JavaScript howere, a wonderful online article by Joel Olawanle (https://dev.to/olawanle_joel/password-generator-with-javascript-57c) was vital in the creation of this application.  There are still some issues to work out, which will be addressed in the future.
